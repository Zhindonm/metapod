Notes trying to learn about bug hunting. As I go through my own learning experience the information below will change.


## Learning resources

- [hackerone](https://www.hackerone.com/) - A community of hackers and bug hunters. There are several programs listed here which you can sign up for that include several topics (IoT, IOS, Android, Windows, etc). More importantly you can find
    - [hacker101](https://www.hackerone.com/hacker101), a collection of resources to learn about web security and learn how to be a bug hunter.
    - If you have signed up for hackerone, you also get access to their [CTF](https://ctf.hacker101.com/ctf).

    You can find my writeups for the challenges shown in hacker101 [here](kakuna/Hacker101/CTF/progress.md).
